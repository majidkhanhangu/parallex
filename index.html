        The About page is the section of a website where people go to find out
        about the website theyâ€™re on. Readers will visit this section for many
        reasons and with various questions they want answered, but your
        objective is the same: to inform them why they are on the site or why
        they should be on the site.

      <p>
        Everything we see around us constitutes nature, including the sun, the
        moon, trees, flowers, fruits, human beings, birds, animals, etc. In
        nature, everyone depends on one another to keep the ecosystem healthy.
        For survival, every creature is interrelated and reliant on one another.
        Humans, for example, rely on nature for their survival, and nature
        provides us with oxygen, food, water, shelter, medicines, and clothing,
        among other things. Many shades may be seen in nature, contributing to
        the planets beauty. Along with humans, animals and birds also find their
        habitat and means of survival in nature. Therefore, it is essential to
        take proper care of our nature to maintain a healthy life.

      <h2>Section Three</h2>
      <p>
        Understanding the very law of impermanence is one of the most powerful
        realizations along a path of embracing all that life has to offer. And
        we dont need to look further than nature to gain this understanding; the
        weather, the seasons, the trees, the movement of the ocean, the cycle of
        the moon, the Earth constant rotation, the death and re-birth of all
        matter, and more. Everything rises and passes naturally. Suffering does
        not exist within this rising and passing. We humans simply experience
        suffering when our mind mistakes what is permanent with what is
        impermanent. Let me explain.
